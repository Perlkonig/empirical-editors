A new technique, the Continuous Lexical Decision Task, was tested to determine the whether it is sensitive to differences in local parsing complexity throughout sentences. Experiment 1 demonstrated that subjects performing the task treat sentences as sentences. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the task is sensing to on-line syntactic processing. Results showed not only that Object relatives are harder to process than Subject relatives, but also that parsing complexity is increased at the gap in Object relatives and remains increased for the next couple of words. The results suggest that the difficulty of Object relatives in comparison to Subject relatives lies in the assignment of the head as the filler of the gap.",

Research in word processing has used acronyms as a tool to answer fundamental questions such as the nature of the word superiority effect (WSE) or which is the best way to account for word-reading processes. In this study, acronym naming was assessed by looking at the influence that a number of variables known to affect mainstream word processing has had in acronym naming. The nature of the effect of these factors on acronym naming was examined using a multilevel regression analysis. First, 146 acronyms were described in terms of their age of acquisition, bigram and trigram frequencies, imageability, number of orthographic neighbors, frequency, orthographic and phonological length, print-to-pronunciation patterns, and voicing characteristics. Naming times were influenced by lexical and sublexical factors, indicating that acronym naming is a complex process affected by more variables than those previously considered.",

        "abstract": "Acronyms are not new. Lloyd's Coffee House opened in London in 1688, exactly a hundred years before the First Fleet arrived in Port Jackson, Sydney. Admission and a cup of coffee cost one penny, so the coffee houses were called penny universities. A tin was strategically placed near the entrance and a coin could be tossed in ‘to insure prompt service’, thus coining the acronym ‘tips’.1\n\nTo rail against the overuse of acronyms in medicine, and in other contexts, is likely to prove futile.2 Nevertheless, medical students will be relieved when told ‘we are going to NICU’ that they are merely going on a neonatal ward round and not being arrested. Relief will soon turn to bewilderment when the students hear that the baby is LBW (low birth weight and nothing to do with cricket), SGA, was on IMV and has a TOF (either a Tetralogy of Fallot or a tracheo-oesophageal fistula or both). To understand neonatology, you need to be an expert in interpretation of the TLA (three-letter acronym).\n\nAccording to evolutionary principles, acronyms must serve a purpose, because they have survived for over 300 years, and indeed proliferated. If the use of acronyms shortens ward rounds, this may convey a survival advantage for that endangered species, the resident medical officer (please note the temptation, declined, to say RMO).\n\nBut acronyms and abbreviations have the potential to confuse and even to be dangerous. Hand-over is a notorious time for errors, and a recent audit of 25 hand-over sheets in a children's unit in Birmingham, UK found 221 different abbreviations used a total of 2286 times.3 When shown the abbreviations, paediatric doctors recognised 56–94% of them and other health-care professionals recognised only 31–63%. The USA fares no better,4 even though the US Joint Commission has published a list of 15 dangerous abbreviations, such as U (for micro), Q.D. and Q.I.D. (daily and 6-hourly, respectively) which are risky, have caused patient harm and should never be used.5 There is no obvious solution. The UK authors3 recommend using only ‘standardised abbreviations’, hard to enforce, while the US authors4 suggest electronic health records as the solution, although my hospital's Emergency Department electronic records are still full of ambiguous abbreviations. Continued vigilance and an emphasis on unambiguous terminology, particularly when prescribing, may help limit the damage caused to the English language and to the occasional unfortunate patient.",

Difficulty of comprehension was measured by the speed and accuracy with which subjects judged the semantic reasonableness of sentences. Marked and negatively prefixed adjectives (sad, unhappy) were a particular focus of the study, since their psycholinguistic status, with respect to negation, is uncertain. When sentences contained more than two negatives, comprehension suffered a large decrement. This finding is discussed in relation to Bever's (1970) model and the concept of cognitive overload. Though prefixed and marked adjectives had little effect on comprehension in an otherwise affirmative context, they had a consistent and substantial effect when added to a double negative sentence. Thus, these adjectives appear to function as psycholinguistic negatives, that is, they may be analyzed as “not X”, at least when other negatives are present.",

Results from a questionnaire given in part two of the study showed that the mean percent correct scores for acronym identification was about 55%. Participants showed a highly variable performance on the identification task. Four of the twenty acronyms were incorrectly identified by all of the participants, five were identified by at least 95% of the sample, and performance was between these extremes on eleven acronyms.

An experiment is reported in which three cueing conditions were compared. One format used capitals for the cued material, a second used bold setting, and the third was a control condition. In an attempt to determine the influence of providing a pre-test on the outcome of cueing experiments, three pre-testing conditions were provided: pre-test of cued information, of noncued information, no pro-test. Subjects read a passage for 3 min, and were then given separate tests of cued and noncued information. The results of the test of cued information are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that cueing yields higher scores if a pre-test of cued information or no pre-test has been administered. The test of noncued information showed that capital cueing yielded lower scores than the control, but the bold cuing did not. It seems that with capital cueing, the benefit on the test of cued information is counter-balanced by a decline in the test of uncued information. As such a trade-off did not occur with the bold cueing, this would seem a preferable format. Pre-test condition had a significant effect only on the test of noncued information.",

So it’s probably a sign of progress that there is debate about the movement for plain legal language.\n\nStill, some of the criticism has become stale and should at last be put to rest. The old criticism is, in essence, that we either should not or cannot write in plain language: should not, because it debases the language; and cannot, because of the overriding demands of precision. I have looked at these misconceptions elsewhere. So have other writers. But since the old misconceptions linger, I’ll try to dispel them again here.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s a new criticism that deserves a longer look. The new criticism is, in essence, that plain language doesn’t matter: its approach to communication is too narrow, and there is no empirical evidence that it improves comprehension. These are serious criticisms, and to explain why they are mistaken will require some exploring.",

Kintsch, 1988), investigated the role of text coherence in the comprehension of science texts. In Experiment 1, junior high school students' comprehension of one of three versions of a biology text was examined via free recall, written questions, and a key-word sorting task. This study demonstrates advantages for globally coherent text and for more explanatory text. In Experiment 2, interactions among local and global text coherence, readers' background knowledge, and levels of understanding were examined. Using the same methods as in Experiment 1, we examined students' comprehension of one of four versions of a text, orthogonally varying local and global coherence. We found that readers who know little about the domain of the text benefit from a coherent text, whereas high-knowledge readers benefit from a minimally coherent text. We argue that the poorly written text forces the knowledgeable readers to engage in compensatory processing to infer unstated relations in the text. These findings, however, depended on the level of understanding, text base or situational, being measured by the three comprehension tasks. Whereas the free-recall measure and text-based questions primarily tapped readers' superficial understanding of the text, the inference questions, problem-solving questions, and sorting task relied on a situational understanding of the text. This study provides evidence that the rewards to be gained from active processing are primarily at the level of the situation model rather than at the superficial level of text-base understanding.",

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded as subjects viewed familiar and unfamiliar acronyms, words, pseudowords, illegal strings, and—as the targets of the substantive behavioral task—proper names. Familiar acronyms elicited repetition effects on the N400 component, a functionally specific index of semantic activation processes; repetition effects for familiar acronyms were similar in magnitude, timing, and scalp distribution to those for words and pseudowords.

We created a series of scientific abstracts, corresponding to real publications on three scientific topics at four levels of difficulty—varying from the difficult, traditional style to an engaging, accessible style. We gave these abstracts to a team of readers consisting of 170 third-year undergraduate students. Then, we posed questions to measure the readers’ readability, confidence, and understanding with the content. The scientific abstracts written in a more accessible style resulted in higher readability, understanding, and confidence. These findings demonstrate that rethinking the way we communicate our science may empower a more collaborative and diverse industry.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the extent to which concreteness influences the acquisition and subsequent processing of novel (low frequency) concepts. Participants were trained on 70 rare English words (35 concrete, 35 abstract) paired with definitions. ERPs were then recorded while participants performed a semantic categorisation (concrete vs. abstract) and a lexical decision task on single-meaning, multi-meaning and the newly acquired words. During training there was a significant effect of concreteness, in that participants were more successful at acquiring concrete concepts. In both the semantic categorisation and the lexical decision task, concreteness effects were evident in the behavioural and in the ERP data for all word types, with concrete words eliciting more negative waveforms than abstract words in the N400 time window. Behaviourally, participants experienced greater difficulty in judging the concreteness of multi-meaning words, yet concreteness effects in the N400 were equally strong for all three word types across both tasks. These findings indicate that concreteness represents a fundamental distinction in the way that items are represented in memory, which is independent of the participant's perceived judgement. They further demonstrate that novel concepts can be acquired rapidly after minimal training, and that the neurophysiological correlates associated with processing novel words are modulated by the specific nature of the conceptual characteristics assigned to the word.",

In Experiment 1, associated targets were named faster than neutral targets when primes and targets were homogeneous for concreteness (i.e., concrete–concrete or abstract–abstract), but not when they were heterogeneous (i.e., concrete–abstract or abstract–concrete). Experiments 2 and 3, using lexical decision, showed priming for all pairs irrespective of prime and target concreteness. In Experiment 4, the prime was presented for 16.7 ms, followed immediately by a 168-ms random letter mask. Lexical decision times showed priming similar to that in Experiment 1. If priming in Experiments 1 and 4 reflected lexical processes, whereas priming in Experiments 2 and 3 entailed postlexical processes, then lexical processes may be functionally distinct for concrete versus abstract words. These findings are more consistent with dual-coding than common-coding explanations of concreteness.",

However, a majority of undergraduates admit to deliberately increasing the complexity of their vocabulary so as to give the impression of intelligence. This paper explores the extent to which this strategy is effective. Experiments 1–3 manipulate complexity of texts and find a negative relationship between complexity and judged intelligence. This relationship held regardless of the quality of the original essay, and irrespective of the participants' prior expectations of essay quality. The negative impact of complexity was mediated by processing fluency. Experiment 4 directly manipulated fluency and found that texts in hard to read fonts are judged to come from less intelligent authors. Experiment 5 investigated discounting of fluency. When obvious causes for low fluency exist that are not relevant to the judgement at hand, people reduce their reliance on fluency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not to be influenced by the irrelevant source of fluency, they over-compensate and are biased in the opposite direction. Implications and applications are discussed.",

Forty Ss heard SE sentences, one-half of which had the relative pronouns deleted. The presence or absence of the relative pronouns in a particular sentence was counterbalanced across groups. The Ss also heard right-branching sentences. It was found that presence of the relative pronouns led to significantly faster phoneme monitoring times and to marginally better paraphrasing (i.e., to better comprehension) in the SE sentences. It was concluded that relative pronouns are effective cues and, further, that the phoneme monitoring technique is a better index of comprehension difficulty than the paraphrasing technique. Reasons for the previous experimental discrepancies were discussed.",

The first experiment, a partial replication of Gould's (1981) study, compared the efficiency and quality of 15 experienced writers' persuasive letters written in three counterbalanced conditions: pen and paper, standard personal computer, and advanced workstation. Analyses of time to compose and length of the resulting letters showed that when composing with the advanced work-stations, writers wrote for longer periods of time and composed longer letters than when composing with pen and paper. Rate of composition (words per min) was similar in all three conditions. Scores for content quality, mechanics quality, and total quality were also collected and analyzed. Letters composed with the personal computer were poorer in content quality and total quality. There were no differences in mechanics quality. In the second experiment, 8 of the original 15 writers revised two of their letters in the medium with which they were composed. Think-aloud protocols collected while the writers revised their letters were collected and analyzed. When revising with pen and paper, writers planned more than when revising on-line; they also planned more before beginning their revisions. However, when revising in the computer conditions, writers reread their texts more and paid more attention to the medium than when revising on paper.",

The verbs were either positive (for example, remember) or inherently negative (forget); the conclusions interrogated either presuppositions (the dog is supposed to be out) or implications (the dog is out). Subjects found it easier to verify positive components as true, but negative components as false. This happened regardless of the polarity (positive or negative) of the parent sentence. Also, subjects took longer on negative verbs, but by an equal amount on both components, even though such negation does not logically affect presuppositions. This suggests that people may examine implications before presuppositions regardless of which component is interrogated.",

        "abstract": "According to a two-step account of the mere-exposure effect, repeated exposure leads to the subjective feeling of perceptual fluency, which in turn influences liking. If so, perceptual fluency manipulated by means other than repetition should influence liking. In three experiments, effects of perceptual fluency on affective judgments were examined. In Experiment 1, higher perceptual fluency was achieved by presenting a matching rather than nonmatching prime before showing a target picture. Participants judged targets as prettier if preceded by a matching rather than nonmatching prime. In Experiment 2, perceptual fluency was manipulated by figure-ground contrast. Stimuli were judged as more pretty, and less ugly, the higher the contrast. In Experiment 3, perceptual fluency was manipulated by presentation duration. Stimuli shown for a longer duration were liked more, and disliked less. We conclude (a) that perceptual fluency increases liking and (b) that the experience of fluency is affectively positive, and hence attributed to positive but not to negative features, as reflected in a differential impact on positive and negative judgments.",

These estimations were compared with norm values and with estimations obtained from a sample of laypersons. Laypersons showed a stronger bias than experts. Study 2 revealed that knowledge estimations can be influenced by labeling knowledge items as specialist knowledge. The results are suggestive of ways in which communication between experts and laypersons could be enhanced. Especially in asynchronous communication situations, as for example in the use of e-mail based hot lines, if experts are to communicate effectively, they must make accurate assumptions about laypersons' knowledge of the topic.",

The processing role of these rules was investigated by comparing performance on reading simple passages that conformed to or violated conventional paragraph organization. In three experiments, subjects read such passages, presented one sentence at a time; data collected were a choice of “best title,” which provided a measure of apparent theme, the reading time on each sentence, and gist recall scores. The results were that bad paragraph structure produced (a) fewer choices of the topical proposition as the best title; (b) longer reading times, mainly on the initial incoherent sentences, which can not be immediately integrated; and (c) lower recall of passage content, especially of the initially unintegrable sentences. These results suggest that unintegrable input must be held in immediate memory pending integration, leading to a greater processing load. The role of the paragraph structure conventions is thus to minimize memory load.",

A review of research on the importance of cues in the reading process suggests that heading miscues might seriously impair understanding. Three experiments were conducted to discover how headings cue or miscue adult readers. Results of the first two experiments indicated that headings may be very important in some documents and suggested factors that differentiate between effective and ineffective headings. Results of the third experiment suggested that misleading headings can be offset by clear prose and led to the conclusion that the role headings play in documents is dependent on the nature of the document and on the reader's degree of familiarity with it. In attempting to write headings that help readers, document writers should consider that effective documents develop a human-centered network of ideas focusing on their audience's needs and that they are based on the \"scenario principle,\" providing examples of scenarios in which the reader will likely play a part. Writers of headings should (1) adopt the scenario principle, (2) anticipate readers' questions, (3) clarify all terms used, and (4) make sure that short, definitional headings are accurate and specific.",

This article presents the results from our study—the first quantitative readability study of plain-language court forms in the United States.\n\nThe study was designed with advice from academic researches, a field-test expert, a statistician, and linguists. We selected 60 citizens on a jury panel to respond to brief questionnaires that tested the comprehensibility of plain-language forms and the corresponding traditional forms. The results show a marked and statistically significant improvement in reader comprehension when court forms are converted to plain language. The results also suggest that because users understand more clearly what they have to do, when they have to do it, and where to seek support if they need it, there may be significant economies for the court.",

Unfortunately, in all these tasks performance on acronyms resembled performance on pseudowords more than performance on words. To further assess the similarity of acronyms and words, we focused on the meaning of the acronyms and used masked priming to examine whether target words can be primed to the same extent with associatively related acronyms as with associatively related words. Such priming was possible at a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 84 ms. In addition, the priming of the acronyms did not depend on the letter case in which they were presented: The target word “books” was primed as much by isbn and iSbN as by ISBN.",

Results of Exp I, in which separate groups of Ss judged each word type, and of Exp II, in which all Ss judged mixed blocks of both word types, indicate that there was a small speed advantage for concrete nouns in lexical decision. To observe transfer effects from one word type to the other, all Ss in Exp III made judgments within blocked presentations of each word type. Findings show that when blocks of abstract words followed blocks of concrete words, judgments for the abstract words were significantly longer than those for concrete words. When concrete blocks followed abstract blocks, however, there was no difference in response time for the 2 word types. It is concluded that the effect of concreteness in lexical decision appears to be critically sensitive to order of presentation. Implications for models of common vs dual representation in lexical memory are discussed.",

The point at which the thematic title was presented was varied: (a) before the passage, (b) after the passage, or (c) not at all (control group). Free-recall performance was best for the Before group, showing that knowledge of the theme aids retention. Performance of the After and control groups was not significantly different. This finding indicates that the locus of the thematic effect is at the initial storage of the material during input.",

        "abstract": "Empirical evidence demonstrates that when jurors do not understand the law, both the process (deliberations) and the outcome (verdicts) of trials become 'lawless.' Such lawless decisionmaking can result in guilty litigants not being brought to justice or in litigants unjustly losing their freedom, property, or even their lives. To help correct the problem, jury instructions should be presented in written and oral form and at the beginning as well as at the end of trials. The instructions should be tested on volunteer jurors; instructions judged incomprehensible should be rewritten and retested. This rewriting/retesting cycle should continue until all points of law touched on by the instructions are easy to understand. The text explains how to implement these procedures, recruit jurors, prepare, administer, and score comprehension tests, and analyze test results. It also describes the facilities needed for such a program. Directions for rewriting cover organization of information, grammar, and vocabulary (with attention to substitute terminology for legal jargon). Footnotes, sample forms, flow charts, and an index are provided. Appendixes include copies of questionnaires, rewritten instructions, and computer programs used to demonstrate the efficacy of the procedures.",

In both studies, easy-to-process pictures elicited higher activity over the region of zygomaticus major, indicating positive affect. The EMG data were paralleled by self-reports of positive responses to the facilitated stimuli. The findings suggest a close link between processing dynamics and affect and may help understand several preference phenomena, including the mere-exposure effect.

The author also discusses at greater length the background to his concerns with current styles of academic writing. The author suggests that the problems with 'nominalization' and 'passivization' are wider than particular cases of abuse as Van Dijk suggests. The author discusses how analysts typically use 'nominalization' imprecisely, employing this same word to denote linguistic entities as well as processes of very different kinds. In replying to Fairclough, the author also points out that some linguists use 'nominalization' to refer to supposed linguistic 'processes' which are not, in fact, processes at all. In consequence, the use of technical terminology, far from leading to greater precision, has led to imprecision and to analysts avoiding basic issues. The author argues that it is important to understand what speakers/writers do with language. Technical nominals, which turn actions into 'things', are often poorly equipped for this task, especially when analysts use technical nouns in place of examining precisely what sorts of actions speakers/writers are performing. The author discusses why the current economic conditions of academic life encourage jargon-filled, technical writing and why, for ideological reasons, academics should resist the pressure to use heavy, nominal-based jargon.",

        "abstract": "Four experiments are reported which attempt to externalize subjects' mental representation of conditional sentences, using novel research methods. In Experiment 1, subjects were shown arrays of coloured shapes and asked to rate the degree to which they appeared to be true of conditional statements such as “If the figure is green then it is a triangle”. The arrays contained different distributions of the four logically possible cases in which the antecedent or consequent is true or false: TT, TF, FT, and FF. For example, a blue triangle would be FT for the conditional quoted above. In Experiments 2 to 4, subjects were able to construct their own arrays to make conditionals either true or false with any distribution of the four cases they wished to choose. The presence and absence of negative components was varied, as was the form of the conditional, being either “if then” as above or “only if”: “The figure is green only if it is a triangle”. The first finding was that subjects represent conditionals in fuzzy way: conditionals that include some counter-example TF cases (Experiment 1) may be rated as true, and such cases are often included when subjects construct an array to make the rule true (Experiments 2 to 4). Other findings included a strong tendency to include psychologically irrelevant FT and FF cases in constructed arrays, presumably to show that conditional statements only apply some of the time. A tendency to construct cases in line with the “matching bias” reported on analogous tasks in the literature was found, but only in Experiment 4, where the number of symbols available to construct each case was controlled. The findings are discussed in relation to the major contemporary theories of conditional reasoning based upon inference rules and mental models, neither of which can account for all the results.",

Incidental experiences of difficulty or disfluency--receiving information in a degraded font (Experiments 1 and 4), in difficult-to-read lettering (Experiment 2), or while furrowing one's brow (Experiment 3)--reduced the impact of heuristics and defaults in judgment (Experiments 1 and 3), reduced reliance on peripheral cues in persuasion (Experiment 2), and improved syllogistic reasoning (Experiment 4).

The third part presents a lifespan view of writing in early and middle childhood, adolescence, higher education, and the world of work. There follows an examination of the relationships of language processes –at the word, sentence, and text levels—to the cognitive processes in writing. Part V covers representative research on the cognitive processes of writing—translation and reviewing and revision—and the working memory mechanisms that support those processes. A review of the current technologies used to study these cognitive processes on-line as they happen in real time is provided. Part VII provides an introduction to the emerging new field of the cognitive neuroscience of writing made possible by the rapidly evolving brain imaging technologies, which are interpretable in reference to paradigms in cognitive psychology of writing.

Research has helped demonstrate that plain language strategies work, not only to improve reader comprehension, but also to save individuals and organizations time and money. Most plain language research focuses on the outcomes of plain language texts; however, there are a variety of complex processes that happen behind the scenes as these texts are produced. To better understand the complexity of plain language work and the challenges of producing these texts, this dissertation studies plain language using rhetorical and sociolinguistic theories. This framework allows us to see how plain language produces meaning within complex social and cultural contexts. Using the rhetorical triangle as an organizing framework, this dissertation proposes three models of research for studying plain language, each emphasizing a different part of the triangle: readers, writers, and texts.",

Four studies manipulate the fluency of preference formation by presenting descriptions in an easy- or difficult-to-read font (Study 1) or by asking participants to think of few versus many reasons for their choice (Studies 2–4). As the authors predict, subjective experiences of difficulty increase choice deferral (Studies 1 and 2) and the selection of a compromise option (Studies 3 and 4), unless consumers are induced to attribute the experience to an unrelated cause. Unlike studies of decision conflict, these effects are obtained without changing the attributes of the alternatives, the composition of the choice sets, or the reference points.

Often, however, such guidelines are not consistent with the actual practices of good writers and are therefore ineffective. As a case in point, the paper discusses the guideline “Avoid whiz-deletions,” taken from a highly-acclaimed plain English handbook. It is shown that whiz-deletions, or reduced relative clauses, actually abound in good writing. They outnumber full relative clauses by a 4-to-1 margin in good standard prose and by an 8-to-1 margin in model plain English documents. Whiz-deletions are useful in helping to de-emphasize information, promote sentence rhythm, facilitate parsing, avoid ambiguity, and omit needless words. The maxim in its original form should be replaced by a more descriptively-accurate one that reflects these features. In general, the plain English movement should promote only those guidelines that are consistent with the practices of good writers. Furthermore, such guidelines should be formulated so as to direct the attention of novice writers to broader contextual factors, not just sentence-based ones.",

These pieces refer explicitly to a research report in the same issue, and in addition to their own agendas, re-present the researchers’ claims and supporting evidence. To investigate how the core of an argument survives, the expression claims and lines of support in epitomizing figures are compared.

We review variables known to influence aesthetic judgments, such as figural goodness, figure-ground contrast, stimulus repetition, symmetry, and prototypicality, and trace their effects to changes in processing fluency. Other variables that influence processing fluency, like visual or semantic priming, similarly increase judgments of aesthetic pleasure. Our proposal provides an integrative framework for the study of aesthetic pleasure and sheds light on the interplay between early preferences versus cultural influences on taste, preferences for both prototypical and abstracted forms, and the relation between beauty and truth. In contrast to theories that trace aesthetic pleasure to objective stimulus features per se, we propose that beauty is grounded in the processing experiences of the perceiver, which are in part a function of stimulus properties.",

For another set of sentences and paragraphs, number of words and number of propositions covaried. Subjects read the texts at their own rate and recalled them immediately. For the 16-word sentences, subjects needed 1.5 sec additional reading time to process each proposition. For longer texts, this value increased. In another experimental condition reading time was controlled by the experimenter. The analysis of both the text and the recall protocols in terms of number of propositions lent support to the notion that propositions are a basic unit of memory for text. However, evidence was also obtained that while the total number of propositions upon which a text was based proved to be an effective psychological variable, all propositions were not equally difficult to remember: superordinate propositions were recalled better than propositions which were stucturally subordinate.",

Research on judgment in a variety of domains shows that such fluency effects depend less on the (absolute) level of experienced fluency than on the relative fluency—that is, the change in fluency or the deviation from the expected level of fluency. Changes in an internal state are often more noticeable and perhaps more relevant as a diagnostic cue regarding the environment than the absolute level of that state. Relative experience is therefore particularly informative and accounts for ease-of-retrieval effects as well as classic fluency effects such as the truth effect and the mere-exposure effect.",

The present investigation equates the specificity of all statements, and hence eliminates the disjunctive implication of false affirmatives and true negatives by utilizing the mutually exclusive classes of odd and even numbers as material. Two tasks were used, (a) ‘verification’, i.e. determining whether a statement about a number is true or false, and (b) ‘construction’, i.e. stating a number to make a statement either true or false. In both tasks the form of a statement (affirmative or negative) was significant at the 0·001 level at the end of practice. In the construction task the truth value of a statement (true or false) was also significant at the 0·001 level, but in the verification task it was not significant. These results were obtained from two groups who performed the tasks in a different order. The cognitive processes involved in the tasks are discussed.",

Nevertheless, little attention has been given to limiting retrieval contexts. Two experiments evaluated intentional memory for concrete and abstract word lists in three retrieval contexts: free recall, explicit word-stem completion, and implicit word-stem completion. Concreteness effects were observed in free recall and in explicit word-stem completion, but not in implicit word-stem completion. These findings are consistent with both a bidirectional version of the relational-distinctiveness processing framework (Ruiz-Vargas, Cuevas, & Marschark, 1996) and a second framework combining insights from dual coding theory (Paivio, 1971, 1986) and the transfer appropriate processing framework (Roediger, Weldon, & Challis, 1989). Also, consistent with the relational-distinctiveness framework, the second experiment suggested that concreteness effects might depend on relational processing at encoding: Concreteness effects were observed in explicit memory for related word lists but not for unrelated word lists.",

(S1 and S2 denote first and second clauses in temporal, not linguistic, order.) Subjects remembered the underlying sense of sentences with S1–S2 clause ordering better than those with S2–S1 clause ordering, regardless of transformational complexity. Subjects also showed a response bias, hence better verbatim recall, for sentences with subordinate clause second and for sentences with S1–S2 clause ordering. Sentence confusions indicated that subjects remembered three semantic distinctions: the temporal order, order of mention, and main-subordinate relation of the two described events. A theory of memory for marked and unmarked semantic distinctions was used to account for the results.",

The present study extends this research to the motor domain by investigating the effect of sensorimotor fluency on affective reactions to objects in a categorisation task. In fluent stimulus–response (s–r) trials, grasp-compatible objects were presented on the same side of the screen as the response hand; in non-fluent trials, grasp incompatible objects were presented on the opposite side of the screen to the response hand. Affective responses were measured implicitly using face muscle activity (electromyography). As predicted, participants exhibited greater cheek muscle activity (associated with smiling) in trials with s–r compatible responses compared with incompatible responses. These findings support hedonic models of fluency in which fluent processing elicits direct emotional experience, and suggest that models of hedonic fluency should take into account the integration of the motor system in visual processing.",

Memory for embedded structure is measured in a pairing task that simulates requirements imposed by sentence comprehension. With increasing memory load (number of embeddings), the rate of performance decline is consistent across all (recall and comprehension) conditions, and reflects a loss of order (as opposed to item) information. Short-term memory overload, rather than linguistic complexity, appears sufficient to account for comprehension difficulty. Performance was imperfect even with singly embedded constructions. Recall showed no abrupt failure with multiple embeddings, indicating that memory constraints are not as discontinuous as English syntax might suggest.",

Nothing has yet been reported concerning the important factors in differentiating acronyms (e.g., BBC, HIV, NASA) from nonwords. It appears that this task poses little problem for skilled readers, in spite of the fact that acronyms have uncommon, even illegal, spellings in English. We used regression techniques to examine the role of a number of lexical and nonlexical variables known to be important in word processing in relation to lexical decision for acronym targets. Findings indicated that acronym recognition is affected by age of acquisition and imageability. In a departure from findings in word recognition, acronym recognition was not affected by frequency. Lexical decision responses for acronyms were also affected by the relationship between spelling and sound—a pattern not usually observed in word recognition. We argue that the complexity of acronym recognition means that the process draws phonological information in addition to semantics.",

Experiment 1 revealed that slower readers require more time than faster readers to perform microstructure processing, but no differences were found for macrostructure components of reading. Experiment 2 revealed that variations in reading goals influence macrostructure processing but not microstructure processing.

A largely left-hemisphere fronto-temporoparietal network was found to be supramodal in nature, i.e. independent of input modality. In addition, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (LpMTG) were most clearly associated with left-branching complexity. The left anterior middle temporal gyrus (LaMTG) showed the greatest sensitivity to sentences that differed in right-branching complexity. Moreover, activity in LIFG and LpMTG increased from sentence onset to end, in parallel with an increase of the left-branching complexity. While LIFG, bilateral anterior and posterior MTG and left inferior parietal lobe (LIPL) all contribute to the supramodal unification processes, the results suggest that these regions differ in their respective contributions to syntactic complexity related processing. The consequences of these findings for neurobiological models of language processing are discussed.",

In both studies, those with more expertise were worse predictors of novice performance times and were resistant to debiasing techniques intended to reduce underestimation. Findings from these studies suggest that experts may have a cognitive handicap that leads to underestimating the difficulty novices face and that those with an intermediate level of expertise may be more accurate in predicting novices' performance.",

        "abstract": "In response to the rapid adoption of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling (collectively, “fracking technology”) over the past few decades, some provincial governments have developed legislation and regulations to delimit, monitor and safeguard fracking practices. Among these rules are guidelines requiring fracking companies (“operators”) to disclose a wide array of fracking-related information to the regulators that oversee these activities. This information serves several purposes, and has the potential to provide the public with timely and useful information regarding the activities that take place in their communities and potential harms that may result. In this report, we provide an analysis of existing disclosure regimes in the four Canadian provinces where fracking is actively taking place: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. We assess the effectiveness of these disclosure practices, benchmarked against current theoretical and empirical scientific knowledge. Our analysis yields four main conclusions, summarized below.\n\nIn Some Provinces, Regulation Provides a Good Basis for Public Disclosure. Alberta and British Columbia, the provinces with the greatest fracking activity, have strong legislative structures that require operators to disclose information to regulatory bodies. Subsequent reports to the public are based on this information. Moreover, websites currently in use such as BCOGC.ca, AER.ca and Fracfocus.ca provide good infrastructure in terms of accessibility. However, even in Alberta and British Columbia, disclosure regarding some fracking-related issues has not received specific regulatory attention, and in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, relevant regulations are almost non-existent.\n\nLegislation Specifying Public Disclosure of Information Related to Hydraulic Fracturing is Minimal. The vast majority of current relevant legislation covers operator-to-regulator disclosure, and not regulator-to-public disclosure. In fact, only two regulatory provisions (both in British Columbia) require the Oil and Gas Commission to report directly to the public on fracking-related risks. Although various provincial websites enable public inquiry into additional issues, the Canadian public largely lacks regular, legally mandated reporting on fracking issues. \n\nInformation that is Disclosed to the Public is Difficult for Ordinary Citizens to Access and Comprehend. Although websites currently in use such as AER.ca, BCOGC.ca and Fracfocus.ca provide good infrastructure for public disclosure, an additional layer of processing is required to make data easily accessible. At the same time, possibly one of the most conspicuous pitfalls of disclosure systems is the overuse of scientific jargon or language that is otherwise obscure for potential users. We found that almost none of the information that is currently available to the public has been disclosed in a manner that is meaningful to non-specialists. \n\nPublic Disclosure and Access Should be Promoted Despite Scientific Uncertainty. Regulation related to public disclosure need not necessarily depend on the status of ongoing scientific endeavours to unveil the actual risks that fracking poses. Rather, we recommend that decision-makers and public policy leaders adopt a precautionary approach that provides greater public awareness while scientific certainty is being pursued.",

The advantage of our approach is that we can address both standard written language (Google Books) and the more colloquial forms of microblogging messages (Twitter). We find that American English is the dominant form of English outside the UK and that its influence is felt even within the UK borders.

Specifically, the false consensus hypothesis holds that people who engage in a given behavior will estimate that behavior to be more common than it is estimated to be by people who engage in alternative behaviors. A meta-analysis was conducted upon 115 tests of this hypothesis. The combined effects of the tests of the false consensus hypothesis were highly statistically significant and of moderate magnitude. Further, the 115 tests of false consensus appear to be relatively heterogeneous in terms of significance levels and effect sizes. Correlational analyses and focused comparisons indicate that the false consensus effect does not appear to be influenced by the generality of the reference population, nor by the difference between alternative choices in actual consensus. However, the significance and magnitude of the false consensus effect was significantly predicted by the number of behavioral choices/estimates subjects had to make, and the sequence of measurement of choices and estimates. These patterns of results are interpreted as being inconsistent with the self-presentational, motivational explanation for the false consensus effect.",

A series of eye tracking experiments were conducted to explore if coloured words in black text had any impact on reading behaviour outside and inside a Web environment. Experiment 1 and 2 explored the saliency of coloured words embedded in single sentences and the impact on reading behaviour. In Experiment 3, the effects of coloured words/hyperlinks in passages of text in a Web-like environment was explored. Experiment 1 and 2 showed that multiple coloured words in text had no negative impact on reading behaviour. However, if the sentence featured only a single coloured word, a reduction in skipping rates was observed. This suggests that the visual saliency associated with a single coloured word may signal to the reader that the word is important, whereas this signalling is reduced when multiple words are coloured. In Experiment 3, when reading passages of text containing hyperlinks in a Web environment, participants showed a tendency to re-read sentences that contained hyperlinked, uncommon words compared to hyperlinked, common words. Hyperlinks highlight important information and suggest additional content, which for more difficult concepts, invites rereading of the preceding text.",

Subjects later recalled the passages and then generated their own subjective outline of each passage. Overall, the outline manipulation did not significantly influence recall. However, significant negative correlations were found between the amount recalled and the degree of subjective-experimental outline correspondence. These outcomes are discussed in the context of interference theory, a depth-of-processing framework, and an automatic comprehension hypothesis.

Critical discourse analysts have suggested that nominalization (along with passivization) has important ideological functions such as deleting agency and reifying processes. However, the language used by critical analysts, as they explore nominalization, is revealing. They tend to use, and thereby instantiate, the very forms of language whose ideological potentiality they are warning against — such as deleting agency, using passives and turning processes into entities. The concept of 'nominalization' is itself a nominalization; it is typically used in imprecise ways that fail to specify underlying processes. If critical analysts take seriously their own ideological warnings about nominalization and passivization, they need to change the standard ways of writing critical analysis. We need to use simpler, less technical prose that clearly ascribes actions to human agents.",

This book is intended to be used in a course on the psychology of reading or the psychology of language comprehension, or in a graduate seminar on either of these topics. Our experience in teaching both undergraduate and graduate courses on the psychology of reading and language for the last ten years persuaded us that the central issues can be effectively communicated in a common format to all of these potential users. Even though the book presents a thorough account of the psychological processes that occur in reading, we have tried to make it understandable to someone who has had as little as one course in cognitive psychology. Another goal of this book is to extend the theoretical framework to a fairly wide scope, covering the kinds of topics that are of general interest to psychologists and educators. We have developed a precise theory and used it as rigorously as possible to organize and explain a very broad and diverse field.",

Comprehension was monitored by timing subjects while they decided whether a sentence was true or false of their knowledge of the world. The memory process was tapped by examining subjects’ incidental memory for the sentences they had previously verified. The verification latencies indicated that at the time of comprehension, sentences likeIt is true that a fire isn’t cold were often recoded into an equivalent affirmative form, namely,It is true that a fire is hot. However, negative sentences likeIt isn’t true that a fire is cold were not recoded during comprehension. Recoding in recall occurred only for those types of sentences that were recoded at the time of comprehension.",

Subjects were asked to state the topic of presented passages in the form of a noun phrase that designated a single object. The first experiment shows that whether the passage is organized around a single major referent has a powerful effect on the difficulty of identifying the topic. The second experiment shows that which referent appears as the surface subject of individual passage sentences is also a powerful determinant of the perceived passage topic. The results are discussed in terms of the readers constructing a macrostructure for the passage, and selecting the central referent of the macrostructure for the statement of the topic. If the immediate propositional content or the surface structure of a passage does not allow a global topic to be selected, the reader must engage in time-consuming inferential processes to construct a suitable macrostructure for the passage.",

Qualitative differences are assumed between the processes underlying both criteria. A meta-analysis of the truth effect was conducted that compared the two criteria. In all, 51 studies of the repetition-induced truth effect were included in the analysis. Results indicate that the between-items effect is larger than the within-items effect. Moderator analyses reveal that several moderators affect both effects differentially. This lends support to the notion that different psychological comparison processes may underlie the two effects.

The writer, in isolation, constructs a role for his \"audience\" to play, and readers fictionalize themselves to correspond to the author's projection. The way readers fictionalize themselves shifts throughout literary history: Chaucer, Lyly, Nashe, Hemingway, and others furnish cases in point. All writing, from scientific monograph to history, epistolary correspondence, and diary writing, fictionalizes its readers. In oral performance, too, some fictionalizing of audience occurs, but in the live interaction between narrator and audience there is an existential relationship as well: the oral narrator modifies his story in accord with the real-not imagined-fatigue, enthusiasm, or other reactions of his listeners. Fictionalizing of audiences correlates with the use of masks or personae marking human communication generally, even with oneself. Lovers try to strip off all masks, and oral communication in a context of love can reduce masks to a minimum. In written communication and, a fortiori, print the masks are less removable.",

Two further experiments demonstrated an additional fit effect: The truth advantage of concrete statements occurred especially when participants were primed with a concrete (vs. abstract) mind-set (Experiment 3) or when the statements were presented in a spatially proximal (vs. distant) location (Experiment 4).

Achieving this understanding is made difficult by the knowledge effect—a tendency of individuals to assume that their own knowledge is shared by others. Understanding the knowledge effect and methods for reducing it is potentially useful for understanding and teaching writing. In Study 1, we explored the impact of an individual's knowledge of technical terms on that person's ability to estimate other people's understanding of those terms. We assessed how individuals' familiarity with technical terms influenced their predictions that college freshmen and college graduates would understand those terms. Results indicate that familiarity with the meaning of technical terms leads to substantial overestimation of others' knowledge. In Study 2, we evaluated an online tutor designed to improve writers' predictions of other's word knowledge by providing them with feedback on the accuracy of their judgments.",

In order to break this confounding, Experiment I compared the comprehension difficulty of self-embedded and right-branching object relative clauses on two measures of comprehension difficulty. Experiment II made the same self-embedded vs. fight-branching comparison for subject relative clauses. The results of both experiments consistently failed to support the interruption hypothesis.",

The short answer is ‘no’, when one understands editing generically, as an essential part of the process of creating meaning in a text. In reviewing examples on the internet, one sees that it does not disappear, but shifts from a third-party intermediary to the author and the reader, and from human to more automated types of intervention. However, despite the promise of the ‘semantic web’, these kinds of intervention are unlikely to reach high standards on a consistent basis. The absence of experienced human mediation in the writing process — as in other areas of life — can be harmful to public life, and ways should be found to show the added value that they make.",

Sentential representations are sequential, like the propositions in a text. Diagrammatic representations are indexed by location in a plane. Diagrammatic representations also typically display information that is only implicit in sentential representations and that therefore has to be computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit for use. We then contrast the computational efficiency of these representations for solving several illustrative problems in mathematics and physics.\n\nWhen two representations are informationally equivalent, their computational efficiency depends on the information-processing operators that act on them. Two sets of operators may differ in their capabilities for recognizing patterns, in the inferences they can carry out directly, and in their control strategies (in particular, the control of search). Diagrammatic and sentential representations support operators that differ in all of these respects. Operators working on one representation may recognize features readily or make inferences directly that are difficult to realize in the other representation. Most important, however, are differences in the efficiency of search for information and in the explicitness of information. In the representations we call diagrammatic, information is organized by location, and often much of the information needed to make an inference is present and explicit at a single location. In addition, cues to the next logical step in the problem may be present at an adjacent location. Therefore problem solving can proceed through a smooth traversal of the diagram, and may require very little search or computation of elements that had been implicit.",

        "abstract": "68 adults solved problems using information written either as (a) bureaucratic-style prose, (b) a flow chart or algorithm, (c) a list of short sentences, or (d) a 2-dimensional table. Prose was always slower to use and more error-prone than other versions, but error on nonprose formats was affected by problem difficulty. Easier problems resulted in no differential error-rates, although the table was used most rapidly; for harder problems, the algorithm gave fewest errors. Differences in retention strategies appeared when Ss worked from memory-performance with prose and short sentences continued to improve over trials, whereas performance with the algorithm and table deteriorated. It is concluded that the optimal format for written information depends on conditions of use.",
